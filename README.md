# Console-Finances

## Description

This project aims to create a console that calculates financial functions from a dataset. This is useful as the same calculations can be used as more data is added, or if anything needs to be changed, and it will still work. It aims to solve the issue of having to manually do these calculations with such alarge dataset, reducing risk of errors. I have learnt how to manipullate data on Javascript and become more comfortable using many of the functions in this project.

## Usage

To use, you may add or edit data to the data set where it is appropriate in terms of date. To view the results, open the index.html page in Chrome browser, click inspect, and click console.

## Credits

Starter code and data provided by EdX Front End Web Development Bootcamp materials from GitLab.
